# The AMPL solver for maximum clique problem

> [!NOTE]
> An undirected graph $G$ is formed by a finite set of vertices and a set of unordered pairs of vertices, which are called edges. A **clique in a graph $G$** is a complete subgraph of $G$. That is, it is a subset $K$ of the vertices such that every two vertices in $K$ are the two endpoints of an edge in $G$.

> A **maximum clique** is a clique that includes the largest possible number of vertices. The clique number $\omega(G)$ is the number of vertices in a maximum clique of graph $G$.
